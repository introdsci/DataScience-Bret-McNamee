## Abstract

[Here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BGtROJeMPeE) is a link to a short video describing what league of legends is.

So far I have imported my data, cleaned it, added some
more continuous variables, and created some visuals to
analyze the data that I have created. My original data
set did not have enough continous variables so I worked
with the current variables to create some of my own that
I used to created my visuals for this deliverable.

### 1. Discovery and Data Preparation

In this first deliverable I imported the data, 
cleaned it up a bit, and created some continuous
variables with which to create some graphs for analysis.

The second deliverable brought in another 

[Here](deliverable1Link.nb.html) is more information about the dataset.

### 2. Model Planning and Building

The model that I want to focus on is how win rates
between individual champions changes over time.
My first dataset coveres the years 2015-2018, and
the new dataset covers the summer 2019 season. 
I am comparing how champions have gotten better
or worse over the years.

### 3. Results and Operationalization
