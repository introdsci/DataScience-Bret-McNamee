## Abstract

So far I have imported my data, cleaned it, added some
more continuous variables, and created some visuals to
analyze the data that I have created. My original data
set did not have enough continous variables so I worked
with the current variables to create some of my own that
I used to created my visuals for this deliverable.

### 1. Discovery and Data Preparation

In this first deliverable I imported the data, 
cleaned it up a bit, and created some continuous
variables with which to create some graphs for analysis.

[Here](deliverable1Link.html) is more information about the dataset.

Provide a one-sentence introduction with what is covered by the first deliverable along with a link to another html page that gives the details.

### 2. Model Planning and Building

Coming soon...

### 3. Results and Operationalization

Coming soon...
